This is a very simple (and ugly looking) UI to edit Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) indexes.

The source is still messy as I didn't know what I wanted from the start. Read it at your own risk.

Requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	- Java 1.6
	- Access to a Solr instance


Usage:

- Run with bin/helioscope or bin/helioscope.bat
- Choose your index with a url like http://localhost:8093/solr (append /coreName for multi-cores)
- Click Run
- Click a item in left panel
- Edit it in right panel. It must be valid XML.
- 

A few planned features: 

- Editor
  - Adding missing fields or more multi-valueds
  - Non-saved modification indicator
  - Saving backups of the originals before updating
  - Opening a new editor for very large field values, perhaps resolving the XML entities
  - Saving all  
  - XML Syntax Highlight
  - A form view
